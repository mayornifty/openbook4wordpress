<h1>OpenBook for Libraries</h1>

Librarians use OpenBook to promote books on their library websites or related blogs. You can customize OpenBook for your particular library.

<h3>OpenURL Resolver</h3>

Many libraries have an OpenURL resolver that websites can use to link to the library's digital resources, including its catalogue records. The resolver works the way the library has designed it. It may take the patron directly to the catalogue record for the book, or it may provide useful links for finding the book in your library. In the OpenBook Settings panel, you can configure an OpenURL resolver for a library. You can obtain the resolver URL from the library's system administrator or from the <a href='http://www.worldcat.org/registry/institutions'>WorldCat registry</a>.

<h3>Phrase</h3>

If you have configured an OpenURL resolver, you can add `[OB_LINK_FINDINLIBRARY]` to an OpenBook template. Once added, OpenBook will display a link to the OpenURL resolver, using this phrase for the text link. E.g., "Find in the London Public Library".

<h3>Image Source</h3>

If you have configured an OpenURL resolver, you can add `[OB_IMAGE_FINDINLIBRARY]` to an OpenBook template. Once added, OpenBook will display a link to the OpenURL resolver, using this image source for the link. E.g., your library's logo image.

<h3>WorldCat Link</h3>

The default template for OpenBook displays a link to WorldCat for a book's ISBN. If an ISBN is not available, OpenBook uses the title and author to try identify the work. The WorldCat link helps users find a book in a library.
