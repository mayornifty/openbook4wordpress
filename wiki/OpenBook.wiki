#summary OpenBook WordPress Plugin

= Introduction =

OpenBook is for book reviewers, book bloggers, library webmasters, anyone who wants to put book covers and data on their WordPress blog or website. Use the OpenBook button in the WordPress visual editor or insert an OpenBook 'shortcode' with a book number in a WordPress post, page or widget. OpenBook will display a book cover image, author, and other book data from Open Library (http://openlibrary.org). It also displays links to book websites. Users can control the content through templates and styling through a stylesheet. OpenBook inserts COinS to integrate with applications like Zotero. Librarians can point OpenBook to their library records using an OpenURL resolver.
