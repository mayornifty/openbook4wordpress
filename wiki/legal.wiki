<h3>Legal Note</h3>

<p>Open Library cover images are provided by publishers. Publishers generally like that people use their cover images because it promotes book sales. This fact does not necessarily protect the rights of cover illustrators. Also, people may be able to upload covers to Open Library for which they do not have rights. In some countries like the United States, thumbnail representations of artwork fall under fair use provisions of copyright law. The size of a thumbnail varies, but all of the book cover images in Open Library are reduced size. Users of !OpenBook are advised to comply with their local laws. If a publisher, illustrator or other rights-holder asks you to take down a cover image, please do so.</p>
