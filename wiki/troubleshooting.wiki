#summary Solutions to problems others have experienced

<strong>"Unexpected {".</strong> If you are getting an "unexpected {" error when you activate !OpenBook, it is because you have an earlier version of PHP. Your server must support at least PHP 5. Note: my server was set to PHP4, but upgrading to PHP5 was a <a href="http://support.netfirms.com/article.php?id=713">simple switch</a>. 

<strong>Blank post.</strong> If you are using !OpenBook and nothing is happening, e.g., blank post, it is likely that a PHP error is occuring due to a missing requirement, but that !WordPress is suppressing the error. For troubleshooting, enable error reporting. See this <a href="http://forums.westhost.com/showthread.php?t=10186">thread</a>.

<strong>Strange Formatting.</strong> If you using !OpenBook and getting strange formatting results, it is possible that your theme or other plugins have a conflict with !OpenBook. Test switching your theme and disabling other plugins, enabling them one at a time. 

<strong>Visual Editor button fails to open form.</strong> I experienced this problem on my production WordPress server when I was using Internet Explorer 8. I resolved it by clicking IE8's "Compatibility View" button.
