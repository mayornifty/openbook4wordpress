#summary Donate to sites that promote literacy

= Pay It Forward for Literacy =

!OpenBook is an open source plugin, free for anyone's use. I have volunteered countless hours to its production and maintenance. I have also benefited in many unexpected ways. If you already use !OpenBook to promote literacy, I am amply rewarded. If you would like to share the love, I encourage you to donate to a site that promotes literacy. 

Here is one site that I particularly recommend:

= Via Negativa =

Dave Bonta is a poet and literary magazine editor from Pennsylvania. He maintains four excellent literary sites that I have followed for years:

<ul>
<li>Via Negativa, a blog written by Dave and guest writers</li>
<li>Morning Porch, a literary view from Dave's front porch every morning</li>
<li>Moving Poems, a collection of the best video poems on the web</li>
<li>Woodrat Photohaiku, a photoblog</li>
</ul>

He is also a writer and editor of Qarrtsiluni, a literary magazine. 

Countless volunteer hours have generated an enthusiastic following. You can help support hosting and domain registration costs. <a href="http://www.vianegativa.us/">Visit the site</a> and pick one of the following:

<ul>
<li>Purchase "Odes to Tools", Dave's book of poetry</li>
<li>Purchase "Words on the Street â€“ An Inaction Comic"</li>
<li>Purchase Via Negativa swag</li>
<li>Make a !PayPal donation</li>
</ul>

I kindly thank you for paying it forward.
