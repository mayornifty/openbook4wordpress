<h3>Legal Note</h3>

<p>Open Library cover images are provided by publishers. Publishers generally like that people use their cover images because it promotes book sales. It is unclear whether this implicit publisher permission also provides protection for the rights of cover illustrators. Also, people may be able to upload covers to Open Library for which they do not have rights. In some countries like the United States, thumbnail representations of artwork fall under fair use provisions of copyright law. The size of a thumbnail varies, but all of the book cover images in Open Library are reduced size. Users of OpenBook are advised to comply with their local laws. If a publisher, illustrator or other rights-holder asks you to take down a cover image, please do so.</p>

<h3>Blog Post: Book Cover Images and Copyright: Whatâ€™s the Law?</h3>

<strong>Update</strong>. September 22, 2008. My research leads me to this conclusion -- thumbnails fall under fair use, not dissimilar to the way quotes work. A new version of OpenBook (1.6) only uses the thumbnail book covers of OpenLibrary. This size is still quite nice for display.

<strong>Update</strong>. August 13, 2008. See this <a href='http://blog.librarylaw.com/librarylaw/2008/08/book-jackets--.html'>useful article at the LibraryLaw blog</a>. It appears there may be exclusions in a library context, but see the post for details. I have posted a question as a followup to my response to Mark. If only thumbnails are used, does it matter if the copyright holder gives permission?

The use of book cover images appeals to book bloggers and their readers. The web can't deliver the full physical book experience, but the cover image can briefly evoke the feeling. It catches your eye. You can imagine the book in your hand. It also provides some metadata -- the title and author. The artwork often conveys the tone and style of the contents. Book covers are not essential, just a very nice extra. But is it legal to copy them and use them on your website?

My knowledge of copyright is basic: I don't copy someone else's work without their permission. While I have opinions about how copyright should change, I follow copyright law. To my knowledge, my website is clear of copyright violations. I use book covers all the time under the assumption that publishers want people to use them to promote their books, i.e., I have their permission. I'm not offering legal advice, but the assumption is likely safe for your average book blogger.

The release of my WordPress plugin, <a href='http://code.google.com/p/openbook4wordpress/'>OpenBook</a>, changes things for me. The OpenBook plugin provides many people with easy access to book covers. I have been thinking more deeply about book covers and copyright. It has recently been discussed at Code4Lib. I want to put some of the thoughts out there as part of my own process of thinking about this. It applies to OpenBook, but also to the issue of book covers more generally.

<strong>Public Domain</strong>. The book covers provided by OpenBook come from Open Library. Their data is public domain. Are the cover images public domain?

<strong>Publisher Conditions</strong>. Some publishers will make it easy to obtain book covers, but will attach conditions to the usage, e.g., do not alter the image. How are these enforced at any book cover image repository?

<strong>Uploaded Covers</strong>. At Open Library and Web 2.0 sites, I can upload book covers. What is to stop me from uploading a protected image? I could also upload a cover of my own creation; would a publisher care about that? Likely uploaders should have to agree to terms when uploading an image.

<strong>Negative Context</strong>. What if the cover is used in a negative context, e.g., a bad review. Amazon lets anyone post any review on their site, and has told publishers that this extra data will mean more overall sales of the good books. It is a good theory, but does it apply outside of publisher contracts with Amazon. It would be nice to hear a publisher's take on the whole matter.

<strong>Remixing</strong>. What if the cover is remixed, e.g., as part of an art project? How would publishers feel about that?

<strong>Fair Use</strong>. As I understand it, a thumbnail or degraded image use of image is considered fair use under US and Canadian copyright law if used for critical commentary purposes. (Note: at present, OpenBook gives you the option to use full-size covers. That may have to change.)

<strong>International Law</strong>. Does fair use apply internationally as well? Is it enough to tell users to follow their own local laws?

<strong>Competitors and Licensing</strong>. Some vendors sell book covers under licenses. Others give them away on the condition that you don't compete with them. The fact that vendors make money off book covers is what makes OpenBook novel. No one is making money off of OpenBook. It is free and open source software, and there are no limitations placed on using it. OpenBook is probably too small of a project to hit the radar of vendors. Even if it did, it is probably being ignored. I have no wish to tangle with vendors, but I like being able to help libraries with free book covers. Maybe it's time to deal with the issue.

<strong>Old Covers</strong>. (This item added August 29, 2008). Do publishers want people circulating covers of older editions, perhaps even published by a different company, when newer editions are offered for sale. I do not want to use the newer cover if I have read the older work. (Again the thumbnail approach should render this issue irrelevant).

I'm sure there are a lot of intuitive answers and gut reactions to these questions, but I would like to get a better legal handle on these questions. Love to hear your thoughts ...
